# Building a CoAP server and client based on Californium CoAP implementation.

## Incremental learning. Code steps: 

# UDP ============
## 1. Simple GET on one resource. ex: /abc
## 2. Add capability to take paths. ex: /abc/one; /abc/two/hi

## 3. Simple POST: add feature to POST
## 4. Add complexity to exchange payload

# To Do ++++++++++++
## 5. Add capability to Observe

# TCP ============
## T1. Customize transport for TCP
## T2... Repeat all done for UDP
